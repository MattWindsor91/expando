# The format is quite simple; %% acts as a separator delimiting groups
# of macro expansions, in which the first line following a %%
# represents the name of the macro and subsequent lines denote
# potential macro expansions.

# Any empty macro expansion group is ignored, so you can put a %% at the
# beginning or end of the file if you wish.  This can help if you want to
# concatenate macro files.

# Macros whose names begin with | are 'function macros': they behave
# like normal macros except for having a special macro ${}, which
# expands to the function macro's argument.

# Inside a macro expansion:
#   - ${M} expands to a randomly chosen expansion of macro M.
#   - ${M|f} expands to a randomly chosen expansion of function macro |f,
#     with each ${} in the chosen expansion of |f being replaced with ${M}.
#   - ${EMPTY} expands to the empty string.
#   - All leading and trailing whitespace is removed: use ${EMPTY} at the
#     beginning or end of an expansion if you need to preserve it.
#
# The output of `expando` is the expansion of the last macro in the file.
